# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions (and work in progress) for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). My goal this time around is to expand my horizons and get some hands-on experience with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Although public, this repository is mostly intended for my friends and probably isn't very interesting to the developer community at large.
