T_1 = 14

Happens again at 7 * 13 + 14?

Rough algorithm:

- Start at zero(?)
- Add 7 until we find 7n % 13 = 1
- Save that first intersection asâ€¦?
- We know that we'll have T % 7 = 0, T % 13 = 1 at (7 * 13)k + 14
- Start at zero(?)
- Increase k until we find ((7 * 13)k + 14) % 59 = 4

So we're finding a time of first alignment (9), which then repeats with a period of a * b.

I THINK it should be true that we then find the NEXT point of alignment when we add another bus route, then have a new offset and period (a * b * c).

Waaaaaaaait wait wait. This is all wrong. Just going straight for the mod does NOT give us the wait time. We actually need to be doing: timestamp + route - (timestamp % route). Find-and-step still seems right; just need to be finding the right thing.
